# elo

This is an attempt to script the elo team rating algortihm using the 2019-2020 NFL season.

The results call for the Baltimore Ravens to defeat the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl. I am writing this roughly a week and a half before the Super Bowl and while the 49ers are involved, the Ravens are not.
